This application developed by a team and i'm one of the crew.  My specific job in this application is to develop an application that can be used to see information about the village and can call a cop if some incident happen by pressing SOS button at the home page.

Below is the screenshot of the application

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/project4/1.webp" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/project4/2.webp" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
